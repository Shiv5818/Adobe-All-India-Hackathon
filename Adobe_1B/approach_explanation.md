# Approach Explanation

## Overview
This project automates the extraction, ranking, and analysis of sections from collections of PDF documents. The solution is modular, scalable, and leverages modern NLP techniques for robust and maintainable code. The workflow is orchestrated via a Python script and containerized using Docker for portability and reproducibility.

## Methodology

### Modular Design
The codebase is organized into distinct modules:
- **main.py**: Entry point, orchestrates the processing of all collections.
- **pdf_processor.py**: Handles PDF text extraction using `pdfminer.six`, mapping page numbers to text for granular analysis.
- **text_analyzer.py**: (Assumed) Responsible for identifying, ranking, and analyzing document sections using NLP models and heuristics.
- **utils.py**: Utility functions for JSON I/O and timestamping, ensuring clean separation of concerns.

### Data Flow
- Each collection directory contains an input JSON describing the documents, persona, and job-to-be-done.
- For each document, text is extracted page-wise, enabling precise section identification.
- Sections are identified and ranked based on relevance to the persona and task, using a transformer-based model (DistilBERT) for semantic understanding.
- Subsections are further analyzed to provide refined insights, supporting downstream tasks or reporting.
- Results are saved in a structured output JSON, including metadata for traceability.

### Scalability and Robustness
- Logging is used for monitoring and debugging, making it suitable for batch processing and production deployment.
- Error handling is implemented at all I/O and model interaction points, ensuring the pipeline can skip problematic files without halting.
- The modular structure allows for easy extension (e.g., supporting new document types or analysis methods).
- Dockerization ensures consistent environments, eliminating dependency issues and simplifying deployment.

### Model Usage
- The pipeline downloads and caches a DistilBERT model for sequence classification, used in section ranking and analysis.
- Model files are stored in a dedicated directory, and the Dockerfile ensures they are available at runtime.

### Execution
- The Dockerfile sets up the environment, installs dependencies, downloads the model, and runs the main script.
- Users can run the pipeline either in Docker or locally using a Python virtual environment.

## Execution Instructions

**Docker:**
```bash
docker build -t pdf-collection-processor .
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/app" pdf-collection-processor
```

**Local:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
```

## Conclusion
This approach ensures a robust, scalable, and maintainable solution for automated PDF collection analysis, leveraging modern NLP and best software engineering practices. The modular design and containerization make it easy to adapt, extend, and deploy in diverse environments.
