# Approach Explanation: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Methodology Overview

Our solution implements a persona-driven document intelligence system that extracts and prioritizes relevant sections from PDF collections based on specific user roles and tasks. The approach combines heuristic-based section detection with transformer-powered semantic ranking to deliver contextually relevant insights.

## Core Algorithm Design

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
The system processes collections of 3-10 PDFs through a multi-stage pipeline. First, `pdfminer.six` extracts text with precise page-to-text mapping, preserving document structure. Each page is processed independently to maintain granular location tracking for extracted sections.

### 2. Section Identification Strategy
We employ a heuristic-based approach to identify document sections by analyzing text patterns. The algorithm detects headings using multiple criteria: lines shorter than 50 characters that are either fully capitalized, title-cased, or match specific patterns (e.g., "Section X", "Chapter Y"). This approach proves robust across diverse document types from academic papers to business reports.

### 3. Semantic Relevance Ranking
The core innovation lies in our persona-task alignment mechanism. We construct a semantic query by combining the persona role and job-to-be-done task, then use DistilBERT to compute relevance scores between this query and each identified section. The transformer model processes both the query and section content through identical encoding, enabling meaningful semantic comparison. Sections are ranked by their relevance scores, with the top 5 selections per document forming the primary output.

### 4. Subsection Analysis
For granular insights, we perform keyword-based refinement on highly-ranked sections. The system extracts keywords from the persona-task combination and filters section content to sentences containing these terms. This approach ensures the refined text directly addresses the user's specific needs while maintaining readability.

## Technical Implementation

The solution leverages a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns: PDF processing, text analysis, and utility functions. DistilBERT (~250MB) provides semantic understanding while remaining well under the 1GB model constraint. The system processes collections in under 60 seconds, meeting performance requirements through efficient text processing and optimized model inference.

## Adaptability and Generalization

Our approach generalizes across diverse scenarios by avoiding domain-specific assumptions. The heuristic section detection works for various document formats, while the semantic ranking adapts to different persona-task combinations. Whether analyzing travel guides for trip planning, research papers for literature reviews, or financial reports for investment analysis, the system maintains consistent performance by focusing on semantic relevance rather than rigid structural patterns.

This methodology ensures robust, scalable document intelligence that truly connects what matters for the user who matters.
